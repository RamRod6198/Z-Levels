## Getting Started
Use of this mod will require a new save to regenerate the map.

When building upwards you have to watch out for the floor collapsing similar to normal roof collapses. Upper floors need supports. When building lower watch out for dropping the mountain roof on yourself. The stairs are in the structure tab.

## Known Bugs
Natural hole, this is found in the structures tab and it should be avoided, it is only used for infestations underground. Avoid it.
Please report any bugs.

**This mod is currently a beta so it might have issues.**
